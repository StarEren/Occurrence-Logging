# Winter Workterm - Time Elaspe Log Project (2023)

## Contributor = Eren Yilmaz

## This is a work term project to gather an input of true or false, assign a name and record each occurrence in a database.

### My process:
+ Calling in the array and to ask the user to name each occurrence in an array of pass or fail.
+ Calculating the time elasped between each fail or pass to attain cycle time in seconds.|
+ Calling in time and date of each occurance. 
+ Create and record results in a file with all information.

The result would be a system that can log any machine cycle time.
