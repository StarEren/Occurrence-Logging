# Winter Workterm - Time Elaspe Log Project (2023)

## Contributor = Eren Yilmaz

## This is a work term project to gather an input of true or false, assign a name and record each occurrence in a database.

### My process:
+ Calling in the array and to ask the user to name each occurrence in an array of pass or fail.
+ Calling in time and date of each occurance
+ Calculating the time elasped between each fail or pass to attain cycle time in seconds. 
+ Create a file and record results in real time with all information.

The result would be a system that can log any machine cycle time with multiple parts.

### Requirements:
+ [Python 3.9 to 3.11.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/) is required.

### Local Development:
```
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/StarEren/Occurrence-Logging
# Move into directories
